This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP that arises from loose comparison (===) when dealing with null values. The `foo()` function, intended to add two numbers, unexpectedly returns null if one of the inputs is null. This is because the strict equality check `===` considers null to be unequal to any other type, including numeric values. The solution shows how to use type checking to handle null inputs gracefully.
